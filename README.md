## Hey, I'm Nicholas Morey 🐕‍🦺

### Check out [the Ratehub `argocd-diff-action`](https://github.com/ratehub/argocd-diff-action)!

I am taking on a fork of an existing action that was abandoned ([quizlet/argocd-diff-action](https://github.com/quizlet/argocd-diff-action)). This action can improve feedback to developers working in a GitOps repo integrated with ArgoCD. Unfortunately it was missing some key features (e.g., [the ability to exclude paths](https://github.com/ratehub/argocd-diff-action/pull/1), support for [diffing Apps of Apps](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/4706)) and has some long standing bugs (https://github.com/quizlet/argocd-diff-action/issues/8).

I, with the support from my team, am going to bring it up to date with a focus on using CI to keep the feedback cycles short and encourage single piece flow. The CI for the action has already come along way, with improvements such as:
- [ci: auto-merge Dependabot minor version updates #13](https://github.com/ratehub/argocd-diff-action/pull/13)
- [ci(release): add semantic-release workflow #4](https://github.com/ratehub/argocd-diff-action/pull/4)
- [ci(checks): add jest coverage comment to prs #33](https://github.com/ratehub/argocd-diff-action/pull/33)

Check out [my PRs on the action](https://github.com/ratehub/argocd-diff-action/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Amorey-tech+) for a sense of how I like to collaborate!
